**Robotics & Software Engineer | Mathematical Engineering & AI Student**

I am a student of **Mathematical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence** at Universidad Pontificia Comillas (ICAI). My work focuses on the intersection of Autonomous Systems, Robotics, and Machine Learning, with a strong foundation in C++ and Python development for real-world engineering challenges.

### Areas of Expertise

* **Autonomous Systems:** Driverless simulation, sensor fusion, and control logic (Formula Student context).
* **Natural Language Processing:** Experience with Skip-gram models, Encoders, NER, and Sentiment Analysis.
* **Robotics:** Autonomous robot updates, hardware-software integration, and Makefile-based build systems.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Numerical methods and algorithmic implementation for engineering problems.
* **Software Engineering:** Object-oriented programming in C++, Python scripting, and version control.

### Technical Skills

**Programming & Robotics**
- C++, Python, Makefile, Shell

**Data Science & ML**
- PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

**Tools & DevOps**
- Git/GitHub, Linux (Ubuntu), Docker
